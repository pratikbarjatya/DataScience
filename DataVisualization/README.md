# DataVisualization
This repository aims to provide tutorials for implementing various visualisations using Seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh and Networkx 

**Introduction to Data Visualization with Seaborn.ipynb :** Here, we can see how Seaborn can be used for exploratory data analysis. The dataset used for this visualisation can be found here https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/graduates/graduates.html.

**Time-Series Visualization using bokeh.ipynb :** This tutorial shows how Bokeh can be used to create interactive visuals. The dataset is the SF Property Crime data that is available here: https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Monthly-Property-Crime-2005-to-2015/k5vw-3yuz.

**Network Visualization using networkx.ipynb :** In this tutorial, using dummy data, we can see how Networkx can be used to create graphs, which are visualised using Matplotlib and Plotly.

**Geographic Visualization using plotly and geoplotlib.ipynb :** This tutorial shows the use of Plotly to create choropleth and symbol maps.
